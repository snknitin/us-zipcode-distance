# Project - US-Zipcode-Distance


Code to create a Pairwise Zip code Distance Matrix and use an index lookup. This is a tiny utility I built, for use in my work, but I figured it might be helpful to anyone else dealing with zip/postal code distances.

The idea is to form a (41483,41483) matrix where the cell values are the `haversine distances` between two zips that are indexed. We save the index look up and the matrix file as .npy, .json or .pkl to reload and use in different projects
